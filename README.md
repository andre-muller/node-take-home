# GuideCX: Backend Assessment

## Technology

- Node 14 + Express
- TypeScript (if you're wanting to stick to JS for now, checkout the [`javascript`](https://github.com/guidecx/node-take-home/tree/javascript) branch)
- Docker
- Jest
- Prettier
- Eslint

## Development

Update your `.env` file with appropriate values (see another team member)

```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

With Docker:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

Without Docker:

```
$ npm run dev
```

## Debugging

If you're using VS Code then you can use the built-in debugger. After you have the app running with `docker-compose` then you can start the `Docker: Debugger` in the debugger tab.
